## âœ¨ What is Wargames 
<p align="center">
  The wargames are great way to begin security journey with gamified concepts offered by OverTheWire community mentioned down below.
  <br></br>
  You can find more https://overthewire.org/wargames/
  

> NOTE :
While you're challenging with those levels you should save your passwords already achieved by you in .txt file in your main device. You may need those passwords of previous levels . 

## ðŸš€ What is NATAS 
![natasss](https://github.com/boranakova/wargames/assets/56170942/80899ced-84cc-4a69-994d-e446831d3f79)

<br></br>

The community of OverTheWire.org aimed to teach basics of serverside web-security. 
<br></br>
Each level of natas consists of its own website located at http://natasX.natas.labs.overthewire.org, where X is the level number. 
There is no SSH login. To access a level, enter the username for that level (e.g. natas0 for level 0) and its password.

### 0 
In this level you should just view page source and find the comment. 
                 
![0](https://github.com/boranakova/wargames/assets/56170942/8a585dc5-a146-4e52-be60-f267937b928d)
                 
### 0-1 
In this level you should find a way to open page source and find the comment.

![1-2 1](https://github.com/boranakova/wargames/assets/56170942/cf6b05ba-5668-4145-9e88-09259897c07a)
> NOTE :
                 When you inspect the page of NATAS2 , you will find a directory in <b>'img'</b> tag.
                 I simply deleted the file path. Afterwards I kept the directory named <b>files</b>
                 <br></br>
![1-2 2](https://github.com/boranakova/wargames/assets/56170942/5e652de7-2600-4bd7-8f96-19118da5ebd9)

> NOTE : 
> Then you will find a hidden file named <b>users.txt</b>. That will give the password for the next level.


![1-2 4](https://github.com/boranakova/wargames/assets/56170942/780f262e-2b5e-4cb8-840b-d764da0293c4)
                 
             
                 
                 

### 2-3
In this level, you need to have knowledge for understanding the hint given by website.
<br></br>
![2-3 1](https://github.com/boranakova/wargames/assets/56170942/fb56bb09-1845-4a91-b7be-b1c50d836800)
> NOTE : If you said "What the heck this ?!" like me. Well I googled it and found a file named robots.txt. 

#### WHAT IS robots.txt 
Search engine bots examine this file before visiting our website. Then the commands of this file starts to scan our web pages.
When the hint tells us <b> " Not even Google will find it this time " </b> it means not even the bots of Google can track you or examine you.

> NOTE : So i simply put the <b>/robots.txt</b> in my URL like below. Then i found hidden path named <b>s3cr3t</b>
 
![2-3 2](https://github.com/boranakova/wargames/assets/56170942/e45c6792-7482-4e52-b692-c6cebf18c9b0)

> NOTE : I put the hidden path to the URL like below. I found a .txt file named <b>users.txt </b> When I opened the file on my browser , the password for 
> the next level has appeared. 

![2-3 3](https://github.com/boranakova/wargames/assets/56170942/926cd26a-f8f0-4f22-9baf-5dab36b6940f)
<br></br>
![2-3 4](https://github.com/boranakova/wargames/assets/56170942/4d8c1624-cd58-4617-a17d-a0be497ecbb7)

### 3-4
![3-4 1](https://github.com/boranakova/wargames/assets/56170942/9da13ecc-1382-4149-be70-a546a5f8d55d)

In this level , you have to use a tool for examine parameters.Any 
web application analysis tool can help but the most used tool is <b>Burp Suite</b>. So I researched to install and setup the tool in Kali.

> NOTE : You need an also have specify Proxy setting of Firefox for using Burp with the website simultaneously. 
> You should go Settings>Network-Settings>Connection-Settings. 
> Open Manual proxy configuration and type <b> 127.0.0.1 Port : 8080 </b>. Press <b>OK</b> <br></br> You ready to go. 

![3-4 2](https://github.com/boranakova/wargames/assets/56170942/87c7f43a-838b-43d5-a88b-5a31a7e18b15)

> NOTE : I did some research and i learned website visitation called <b>Referring</b>. The NATAS4 wants us to visit here from NATAS5.
> I haven't got password of NATAS5 yet. So I have to pretend to be NATAS5 credentials and arrive from there.
> By that I used Burp to manipulating my referer-header value. I simply changed the number <b>4</b> to <b>5</b> of referer value.                           

![3-4 3](https://github.com/boranakova/wargames/assets/56170942/4466d047-8835-44d0-bc14-cf1dae0b525e)

> NOTE : I forwarded my request in Burp. When the browser triggered i got the password for the next level has shown like below.

![3-4 4](https://github.com/boranakova/wargames/assets/56170942/d5f71a10-3432-4dd7-907c-7dabf62c50ef)

### 4-5




I solved  <b>6-7</b> with this command ;

```sh
find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c & ls-lrha
```
I solved <b>7-8</b> with this command ;
```sh
grep "millionth" data.txt 
```
I solved <b>13-14</b> with this command ;
```sh
ssh -i sshkey.private bandit14@localhost -p 2220 
```

I solved <b>16-17</b> with this command ;
```sh
nmap -sV localhost -p 31000-32000 
```
> NOTE :
I simply put <b>man</b> command to learn what I need for this situation. Then i decided to use <b>-sV</b> ( sV flag lets us do a service/version detection scan while listening these ports. ) using <b>-p</b> for scanning all ports given the range of between 31000-32000. The level wants us to find SSL response of any server. When I found the server I used <b>openssl s_client</b> command then retrieved the password for the next level.
```sh
openssl s_client -connect localhost:31790 
```


### 19-23
In these levels you're going to learn <b>setuid</b> and <b>cron</b> concepts of Linux 
> NOTE : I googled these concepts and learned deeply before solving the level.

I solved <b>20-21</b> with this command ;
```sh
echo -n 'GbKksEFF4yrVs6il55v6gwY5aVje5f0j' | nc -l -p 1234 & 
```
> NOTE : <b>&</b> let the process run in the background. While running this command. I execute the setuid binary in the homedirectory given by level. 
> And I entered the port I specified with <b>nc</b> ( <b>-l</b> flag listens of an incoming connection <b>-p</b> flag specifies a port ).
```sh
./suconnect 1234
```
### 24-26

I solved <b>24-25</b> with this command ;
> NOTE :
> This level wants us to use brute-force method for reaching next level. So I researched how to use <b>for-loop</b> in bash scripting. Then I created a bash file with for loop range between 0000..9999. After recording all these entries. I sorted the result file then found the correct one.
> 
```sh

#!/bin/bash

for i in {0000..9999}
do
        echo UoMYTrfrBFHyQXmg6gzctqAwOmw1IohZ $i >> possibilities.txt
done

cat possibilities.txt | nc localhost 30002 > result.txt
```
I named it bf_entries.sh then I executed the directory 

```sh
./bf_entries.sh 

```
```sh
sort result.txt
```
### 27-34
In these levels you're going to learn some of Git commands.

>NOTE:
> You'll have to clone the remote repository to directory of a current level. I used some of these commands

```sh
git clone ssh://bandit27-git@localhost/home/bandit27-git/repo 
```

>If you obtain the repo successfully , You're going to learn what you supposed to do in this task .
>I used 
```sh
git log 
```
>to find any previous commits.

```sh
git tag 
```
>to find any tags in repo

```sh
git add
```
>to adding the file I created.

```sh
git commit 
```
>to committing my changes.

```sh
git push 
```
>to uploading local repo to remote repo and validate(I gave you a hint this is related to 31-32 ;) ).
