## ‚ú® What is Wargames 
<p align="center">
  The wargames are great way to begin security journey with gamified concepts offered by OverTheWire community mentioned down below.
  <br></br>

> NOTE :
While you're challenging with those levels you should save your passwords already achieved by you in .txt file in your main device. You may need those passwords of previous levels .

<br></br>
It designed by OverTheWire.org for complete beginners and newbies
<br></br>
It will teach the basics needed to be able to play other wargames

This game, like most other games, is organised in levels. You start at Level 0 and try to ‚Äúbeat‚Äù or ‚Äúfinish‚Äù it 

### 0-4 
In these levels you need to understand file , directory and folder concepts of Linux. 

```sh
cd , ls , file 
```

### 5-14
In these levels you're going to find specific requests given in the level. For example : Regular expressions , encoding&decoding (Base64 , rot13) 
```sh
find , grep , sort , base64
```
I solved <b>5-6</b> with this command ;
```sh
find * -size 1033c cat directory_path 
```

I solved  <b>6-7</b> with this command ;

```sh
find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c & ls-lrha
```
I solved <b>7-8</b> with this command ;
```sh
grep "millionth" data.txt 
```
I solved <b>13-14</b> with this command ;
```sh
ssh -i sshkey.private bandit14@localhost -p 2220 
```

I solved <b>16-17</b> with this command ;
```sh
nmap -sV localhost -p 31000-32000 
```
> NOTE :
I simply put <b>man</b> command to learn what I need for this situation. Then i decided to use <b>-sV</b> ( sV flag lets us do a service/version detection scan while listening these ports. ) using <b>-p</b> for scanning all ports given the range of between 31000-32000. The level wants us to find SSL response of any server. When I found the server I used <b>openssl s_client</b> command then retrieved the password for the next level.
```sh
openssl s_client -connect localhost:31790 
```


### 19-23
In these levels you're going to learn <b>setuid</b> and <b>cron</b> concepts of Linux 
> NOTE : I googled these concepts and learned deeply before solving the level.

I solved <b>20-21</b> with this command ;
```sh
echo -n 'GbKksEFF4yrVs6il55v6gwY5aVje5f0j' | nc -l -p 1234 & 
```
> NOTE : <b>&</b> let the process run in the background. While running this command. I execute the setuid binary in the homedirectory given by level. 
> And I entered the port I specified with <b>nc</b> ( <b>-l</b> flag listens of an incoming connection <b>-p</b> flag specifies a port ).
```sh
./suconnect 1234
```
### 24-26

I solved <b>24-25</b> with this command ;
> NOTE :
> This level wants us to use brute-force method for reaching next level. So I researched how to use <b>for-loop</b> in bash scripting. Then I created a bash file with for loop range between 0000..9999. After recording all these entries. I sorted the result file then found the correct one.
> 
```sh

#!/bin/bash

for i in {0000..9999}
do
        echo UoMYTrfrBFHyQXmg6gzctqAwOmw1IohZ $i >> possibilities.txt
done

cat possibilities.txt | nc localhost 30002 > result.txt
```
I named it bf_entries.sh then I executed the directory 

```sh
./bf_entries.sh 

```
```sh
sort result.txt
```
### 27-34
In these levels you're going to learn some of Git commands.

>NOTE:
> You'll have to clone the remote repository to directory of a current level. I used some of these commands

```sh
git clone ssh://bandit27-git@localhost/home/bandit27-git/repo 
```

>If you obtain the repo successfully , You're going to learn what you supposed to do in this task .
>I used 
```sh
git log 
```
>to find any previous commits.

```sh
git tag 
```
>to find any tags in repo

```sh
git add
```
>to adding the file I created.

```sh
git commit 
```
>to committing my changes.

```sh
git push 
```
>to uploading local repo to remote repo and validate(I gave you a hint this is related to 31-32 ;) ).
